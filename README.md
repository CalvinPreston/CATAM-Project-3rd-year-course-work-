# CATAM-Project-3rd-year-course-work-

This work consisted of two projects done in MATLAB. 

Project 1 saw a numerical method of integratin known as the shooting method used t cosntructure models of stellar interiors.
The questions got increasingl more advanced until they eventally implemented a full correction matrix to the method.

Project 2 saw the realisation of star cluster of 5000 stars. Then certain properties were explored (velocity disperion, potantial
and density distributions etc).
